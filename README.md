# Kitchen Chaos

Following along with [CodeMonkey's Unity tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&ab_channel=CodeMonkey)

Major changes from the tutorial game:

* Implemented a greatly simplified stove recipe system that elegantly avoids unnecessary code duplication and state machines
* Player continues rotating towards target direction even after they stop moving
* Plates can interact with container counters directly to get their item
